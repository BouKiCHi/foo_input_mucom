This document is a best-effort attempt at an English introduction by massaging
an auto-translated version of README.md. It is accurate (to the extent
auto-translate is accurate) as of commit 1f306b3,
but does not strictly follow changes to README.md.

# About the OPEN MUCOM 88 Project

A Windows version of MUCOM 88 is released as part of the OPEN MUCOM 88 project.
For more information, see Open MUCOM 88 Wiki<br>
https://github.com/onitama/mucom88/wiki/Home-en

MUCOM 88 for Windows is primarily distributed at the following site:

MUCOM 88 Windows <br>
https://onitama.tv/mucom88/index_en.html

MUCOM 88 is a Music Macro Language (MML) compiler and music creation tool for
the NEC PC-8801 platform developed by Yuzo Koshiro in 1987. In addition to a
compiler, MUCOM 88 provides an FM synthesis driver written in z80 machine code
that understands the MML compiler output, giving an environment for playback
and feedback for the composer.

The OPEN MUCOM88 project aims to be widely used and extended by releasing the
original MUCOM 88 source code alongside OPEN MUCOM 88. Source code and assets
are released free of charge with an open license. License details are
summarized in the "License and Contact" section and "license.txt".

Disk images for the original MUCOM 88 distribution can be found on Ancient
Corp.'s [website](https://www.ancient.co.jp/~mucom88/).

# Building
* The `src` folder contains project files for Visual Studio 2017.
* The `xcode` folder contains a project file for Mac OS X XCode.
* Support for [Hot Soup Processor](hsp.tv) (Japanese only) is found in the
  `hspplugin` folder. English information for HSP is on
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Soup_Processor).
* A `Makefile` is also provided in `src`- it works on Linux and Win32 if using
  [msys2](https://www.msys2.org).

When compiling using the `Makefile`, Linux builds _require_
[SDL 1.2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php). Using SDL is optional on
Windows, and is disabled by setting `OS_WIN32 = 1` in `Makefile.settings`.
`make` must be invoked while `src` is your working directory.

Raspberry Pi Example (Assuming a Debian-based Linux variant- adjust
accordingly if you use a different Linux distribution.):

```
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev
git clone https://github.com/onitama/mucom88
cd src
make
make mini
```

Several companion tools are available:
@BouKiCHi provides Mac OS X binaries. <br>
https://github.com/BouKiCHi/mucom88/tags

@kuma4649/kumatan provides a versatile video game music format music player
(including [VGM](https://vgmrips.net/wiki/VGM_Specification)), and a
utility to convert OPEN MUCOM 88 `.muc` files to VGM format (particularly
using the Sega Genesis chips). <br>
